MonoGame
========

This is a repo where I'm going to put a number of games that I had worked on several years ago in XNA and have
recently ported to MonoGame.

The code style and design might not be up to the quality or standards that I would now expect of myself, but I
don't have the time to go and refactor these things, unfortunately.

The primary reason for this venture was to move off of XNA because of its lack of support from Microsoft and
move to MonoGame which seems to be much more active.
